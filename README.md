# Cancer Incidence and Mortality in the United States (2006–2016)
## #PublicHealth #Statistics #DataAnalysis #Matplotlib #Seaborn

Cancer represents one of the most critical public health challenges in the United States. From a statistical perspective, cancer data allows us to quantify the burden of the disease over time and to analyze how incidence and mortality vary across different population groups. By examining trends disaggregated by sex, age, race or ethnicity, and geographic location, we can identify meaningful patterns and disparities that are essential for evidence-based decision making in public health.

Understanding these statistical patterns is key to evaluating prevention strategies, early detection programs, and broader cancer control policies.

## Project objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

- To identify U.S. states with the highest cancer incidence and mortality rates.
- To determine the most common cancer types based on incidence and mortality in 2016.
- To analyze the distribution of the most prevalent cancer types across sex, racial, and age groups.

## About the data source

The data used in this analysis was obtained from the [United States Cancer Statistics (USCS)](https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/uscs/about/index.htm), the official federal cancer surveillance system. The USCS combines cancer registry data from the CDC’s National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, along with mortality data from the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics.

This nationwide coverage enables population-level statistical analyses and comparisons across states and demographic subgroups.

## About the project

This project was developed as part of the **Statistical Programming** course at the **Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos (UNMSM)**.  
The analysis focuses on data cleaning, aggregation, and exploratory statistical analysis using **Python**. Data visualizations were created using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to illustrate temporal trends, regional differences, and demographic disparities in cancer incidence and mortality.

## Key findings

### Overall cancer patterns

- The results suggest that the Southern and Northeastern regions of the United States tend to exhibit higher cancer incidence and mortality rates.
- In 2016, the three most common cancer sites were Lung and Bronchus, Prostate, and Female Breast cancer, a ranking that remained consistent throughout the 2006–2016 period.
- Trend analysis shows that Female Breast cancer experienced a sustained increase in incidence over the decade, surpassing Lung and Bronchus and Prostate cancer by 2016.
- Female Breast cancer accounted for more than 13% of total cancer-related deaths in 2016, with mortality rates showing an upward trend over time.

### Female Breast cancer

- Mortality associated with Female Breast cancer appears to disproportionately affect the Black female population.
- Across age groups, mortality rates are consistently higher within the Black race category, while the Asian/Pacific Islander group presents the lowest mortality rates.
- When analyzing percentage changes in incidence rates, only two states registered a decline between 2006 and 2016. The District of Columbia shows a notable reduction, exceeding a 15% decrease in incidence.
- In contrast, mortality rates declined in most U.S. states during the same period, suggesting improvements in early detection or treatment.
- In 2016, New Hampshire reported the highest incidence rate of Female Breast cancer.
